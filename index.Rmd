.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[IMAGINE]

* <span style="font-size: 24pt;">Picture MODIS as the keen eye aboard the Terra and Aqua satellites. Terra takes the morning shift, gliding from north to south across the equator, while Aqua takes over in the afternoon, cruising from south to north over the equatorial belt.</span>

]

.panel[.panel-name[OPERATION]

* <span style="font-size: 24pt;">The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) operates aboard the Terra and Aqua satellites, originally known as EOS AM-1 and EOS PM-1 respectively.</span>

]

.panel[.panel-name[CAPTURE]

* <span style="font-size: 24pt;">Both Terra MODIS and Aqua MODIS capture images of the entire Earth's surface every 1 to 2 days.</span>

]

.panel[.panel-name[BANDS]

* <span style="font-size: 24pt;">They utilize 36 spectral bands to collect data across various wavelengths, as outlined in MODIS Technical Specifications</span>

]

.panel[.panel-name[USES]

* <span style="font-size: 24pt;">The datasets from MODIS aid in understanding global dynamics across land, ocean, and the lower atmosphere, while the resulting models are vital tools for policymakers to make informed decisions regarding environmental protection and addressing global challenges.</span>

* <span style="font-size: 14pt;">The two images show the landcover change over time. In April 2021, Mexico was experiencing what was then one of its most widespread and intense droughts in decades, with 85 percent of the country facing drought conditions, according to an article published by NASA’s Earth Observatory on May 5, 2021. Despite those harsh conditions, the October 2021 image still shows much more widespread vegetation compared to October 2023. The expanding drought, highlighted by extensive tan land, is obvious by October 2023, Source: [NASA](https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/gallery/individual.php?db_date=2024-02-27) </span>

The image is centered on large and abundant fires in the state Roraima, in northern Brazil.

With a warming climate, decreasing rainfall, and increasing demands from an increasing population, Lake Chad has been shrinking over the last several decades. It is estimated that it has lost about 92 percent of its former size, while the greater Lake Chad Basin contributes to the food security for 50 million people, Source: [NASA](https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/gallery/individual.php?db_date=2024-03-03) </span>

# Conclusion



---

# Reflection
### 1. MODIS has played a vital role in climate change research spanning more than two decades.

### 2. With its long mission lifespan, MODIS provides extensive time series data for studying gradual changes.

### 3. Despite its spatial resolution limitations, MODIS remains invaluable for monitoring climate changes, pollution,land-use, air-quality, vegetation , urban heat islands, & many other uses.
